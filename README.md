# My-Simple-Calculator

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

This program is designed to carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”basic math operations. 
The application will ask the user to choose one of the four operations before requesting two integers for the selected 
operation to be applied to. The user will see the operation's outcome on screen. Overall, this program seeks to provide 
users with a straightforward and effective method for doing fundamental mathematical operations while avoiding errors and maximizing 
user pleasure. The user will then be prompted to try again or exit the program.

Enjoy and Thank you for using my program!!
